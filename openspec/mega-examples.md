## Pattern Reference

Each example uses one or more of these patterns:

| Pattern | Description | Key Components |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tools** | External capabilities | DuckDuckGo, Calculator, custom functions |
| **Knowledge** | RAG with vector search | LanceDB, embeddings, document ingestion |
| **Memory** | Persistent state | SqliteDb, session_state, user_memories |
| **Structured Output** | Typed responses | Pydantic models, output_schema |
| **Workflows** | Multi-step processes | Sequential/parallel steps, conditions |
| **Teams** | Multi-agent collaboration | Coordinate, route, collaborate modes |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 0**: Fix existing issues (parallel_steps, knowledge demos)
2. **Phase 1**: Create directory structure and migrate existing examples
3. **Phase 2+**: Build new examples by category (10 per sprint)

See `openspec/categories/*.md` for detailed specs per category.
