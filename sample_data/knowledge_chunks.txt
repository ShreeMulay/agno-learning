    Agents in Agno are AI programs where a language model controls execution flow.
    The model decides whether to reason, use tools, or respond to the user.
    Agents are created using the Agent class with a model and optional instructions.
    


    Tools extend agent capabilities by allowing them to interact with external systems.
    Tools are Python functions that agents can call to fetch data or perform actions.
    Agno includes 100+ pre-built tools and supports custom tool creation.
    


    Knowledge bases enable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns.
    Documents are chunked, embedded into vectors, and stored in a vector database.
    When a query is made, relevant chunks are retrieved and added to the LLM context.
    


    Memory allows agents to remember information across sessions.
    User memories persist preferences, facts, and context about the user.
    Session state provides temporary storage within a single conversation.
    


    Teams enable multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks.
    A team has a leader agent that coordinates work among member agents.
    Teams can operate in coordinate, route, or collaborate modes.
    


    Workflows provide structured orchestration of agent tasks.
    Each workflow step can involve different agents or operations.
    Workflows support sequential, parallel, and conditional execution.
    


    Vector search finds similar content using mathematical distance metrics.
    Common metrics include cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.
    The embedding model converts text to high-dimensional vectors.
    


    LanceDB is a local vector database that requires no server setup.
    It stores vectors in the Lance format for fast similarity search.
    LanceDB supports both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search.
